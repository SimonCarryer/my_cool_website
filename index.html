                    <h2>Essays</h2>
                    <p>I've published a bunch of essays on <a href="https://medium.com/@simoncarryer">Medium</a>.</p>
                    <p><a href="https://medium.com/@simoncarryer/damn-near-killed-him-30042c796e29">Damn Near Killed
                            Him</a>
                        is about President James Garfield's pretty revolting death. <a

                        is about tech industry culture stuff.</p>
                    <p>A lot of my essays are about, like, data stuff, since that's what I do for work. <a
                            href="https://medium.com/@simoncarryer/i-spoiled-wordle-with-this-one-weird-trick-5e2343475d46">I

                        festival. <a href="https://medium.com/@simoncarryer/a-stab-in-the-dark-8861a6bbab4b">A Stab in

                    <p>Finally, I wrote a really long series about various techniques in machine learning. I've been
                        meaning
                        to rehost that somewhere else since the articles are soft-paywalled, but for now they're still
                        on
                        Medium.
