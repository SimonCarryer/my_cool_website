                            of the Undying</a></h2>
                    <p>Moldvay's “The Lost City” is without a doubt my favourite of the early D&D modules. There's so
                        much fun to be had with the weird Cynidiceans, the faction play, and the mystery of what's
                        happening in the pyramid. I've run this adventure top-to-bottom probably three or four times,
                        over dozens of sessions. I've gathered what I learned from that into this “fan edit” dungeon,
                        which I hope allows more people to appreciate what I love about the Lost City. In brief, here
                        are the changes I've made:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Removed the “lower levels” and rewritten the history of the pyramid to fit this.</li>
                        <li>Moved the setting to medieval/early modern Earth.</li>
                        <li>Removed some “D&Disms” such as evil humanoids and some other monsters.</li>
                        <li>Edited the text and layout for easier reference.</li>
                        <li>Changed treasure to a silver standard and slightly reduced the amount of treasure.</li>
                        <li>Expanded information on joining each of the factions.</li>
                        <li>Made minor adjustments to the maps and some encounters for tighter themes and more varied
                            paths.</li>
                    </ul>
