    <p class="c0"><span class="c3">For the following I have considered spells from the Basic book of B/X D&amp;D. Other
            editions and other games will have different spells, but hopefully the reasoning carries.</span></p>
    <h3 class="c9" id="h.fszblpx1r4zv"><span class="c13">Level One</span></h3>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c6">Sleep: </span><span>&nbsp;Bar none, the best spell in the game. The ability to
            reliably take out a whole roomful of 1HD enemies makes </span><span class="c7">Sleep</span><span
            class="c3">&nbsp;indispensable for parties up to mid levels, and single-handedly makes the Wizard a viable
            character at first level. Opinions vary on whether slitting the throats of your sleeping victims is strictly
            Lawful, but even absent that it remains the number one first level spell by a long margin.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c6">Charm Person:</span><span>&nbsp;Dungeon expeditions succeed or fail on the strength
            of their intelligence gathering. </span><span class="c7">Charm Person</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;creates a
            willing, eager informant out of any intelligent dungeon denizen. Even a short-duration charm is more than
            enough time to get useful information, and the fact that they might feel a little violated afterwards is
            little downside at all.</span></p>
    <h3 class="c9" id="h.ynqp9ynhhpak"><span class="c13">Level Two</span></h3>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c6">Invisibility:</span><span>&nbsp;What makes </span><span
            class="c7">Invisibility</span><span>&nbsp;so powerful is its duration. It lasts until the target attacks or
            casts a spell. For a scout, neither of those are part of their regular duties. That means for the price of a
            Level Two spell you get the services of an invisible scout for the whole day. Over a few days you can make
            the whole party invisible. The major weakness of </span><span class="c7">Invisibility</span><span
            class="c3">&nbsp;is how it treats light sources - invisible scouts must scout in the dark, or else carry a
            light which gives away their presence.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c6">Continual Light: </span><span>This spell solves lighting problems for the party
            forever. The huge strength of this spell is that, being permanent, it can be cast in downtime, providing the
            party with near-infinite light sources. Casting </span><span class="c7">Continual Light</span><span
            class="c3">&nbsp;on arrows or crossbow bolts provides the party with a way of projecting light to counter
            enemies lurking out of sight. The ability to cover and then suddenly reveal a magical light source gives the
            party advantages in both stealth and in surprise, dismaying light-sensitive enemies.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span>A perennial threat to low-level parties is being attacked with ranged weapons from outside the
            range of their lighting. </span><span class="c7">Continual Light</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;and other
            light spells create possibilities for countering this strategy. Cast on the end of an arrow or bolt, you can
            project light at a distance.</span></p>
    <h3 class="c9" id="h.zc64o6cfisln"><span class="c13">Level Three</span></h3>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c6">Fireball:</span><span>&nbsp;The game changer. There&rsquo;s not much in the game
            that&rsquo;s not intimidated by 5d6 damage. Even if they make the saving throw, </span><span
            class="c7">Fireball</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;is instant death for most 2-3HD foes. Once the Wizard
            learns Fireball, any Fighters in the party are relegated to second rank.</span></p>
    <h3 class="c9" id="h.3nb52z2mo0rx"><span class="c13">Cleric spells</span></h3>
    <p class="c0"><span>The Cleric is often relegated to the role of mobile Cure Light Wounds platform. I think this is
            a waste of the Cleric&rsquo;s potential. Cure Light Wounds is of course extremely useful, indispensable even
            in campaigns with standard (1HP per day) healing. But that&rsquo;s a </span><span
            class="c7">downtime</span><span>&nbsp;concern. Prep and cast Cure Light Wounds on your day off. In the
            dungeon, there are better uses of your precious spells. Cleric spells tend to be rather situational, so
            it&rsquo;s hard to choose the overall best spells. But if I had to choose, at first level </span><span
            class="c7">Protection from Evil</span><span>&nbsp;would be my pick. Cast on the front-line Fighter or the
            scout, it provides all-day benefits, and the complete immunity from many enemies can be invaluable. The
            other option is </span><span class="c7">Light</span><span class="c3">, which has great practical utility,
            and doubles as an offensive spell.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span>At the second level it gets even harder. </span><span class="c7">Find Traps</span><span>&nbsp;is
            frequently useful and </span><span class="c7">Hold Person</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;is also a strong
            choice, especially if you&rsquo;re expecting powerful humanoid enemies.</span></p>
