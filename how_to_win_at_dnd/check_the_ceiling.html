                    <p class="c0"><span>There are few rules in D&amp;D that have no exceptions. Every strategy has advantages and
                            disadvantages. The axioms in this book are strategies which are </span><span class="c7">on
                            average</span><span>&nbsp;a net positive for dungeon effectiveness. Not so with checking the ceiling.
                            It&rsquo;s all upside. I suppose one day I&rsquo;ll run into a dungeon where every archway has an
                        </span><span class="c7">Explosive Rune</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;carved into its apex, but until that day
                            I&rsquo;m going to claim that you should always, always check the ceiling.</span></p>
                    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p>
                    <p class="c0"><span class="c3">This kind of action, like probing ahead with a 10&rsquo; pole, looking through
                            keyholes, listening at doors, falls into a category I like to call &ldquo;exploration doctrine&rdquo;. The
                            set of actions you take when exploring a door, room, or corridor, to safely detect dangers before they kill
                            you. There&rsquo;s a trade-off between thorough examination of the environment, and time spent (incurring
                            the risk of random encounters). Optimal exploration doctrine considers the kinds of threats previously
                            encountered (are there lots of traps? How deadly are they?) and the nature of random encounters (can your
                            party handily defeat any likely encounters?). </span></p>
                    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p>
                    <p class="c0"><span class="c3">In practice I find that there&rsquo;s little to be gained from micromanaging
                            exploration. It gets tedious listing every single action you take every single time, for fear of the DM
                            yelling &ldquo;Gotcha! You didn&rsquo;t say you checked the ceiling this time!&rdquo; I recommend an
                            explicit and fairly static standard exploration doctrine. Write down your door procedure, your corridor
                            procedure and so on. List each action you take, and how long the whole procedure takes. Tell the DM
                            you&rsquo;re using this standard approach unless you explicitly say otherwise. It&rsquo;ll save time in
                            play, it saves pointless bickering about who did what when, and it ensures that you always, always check the
                            ceiling.</span></p>
