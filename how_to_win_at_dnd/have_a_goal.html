                    <p class="c0"><span class="c3">When you go into the dungeon, know what you&rsquo;re trying to achieve. Lacking a
                            goal, parties tend to wander, waste time, fight too many random encounters, make bad choices, and get
                            killed. If you don&rsquo;t have enough information to form a coherent goal, make getting that information
                            your goal. Keeping good notes and clear maps is helpful here. Sessions should start with reviewing your map
                            and your notes, and deciding on the goal for the session.</span></p>
                    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p>
                    <p class="c0"><span class="c3">Goals in the dungeon tend to fall into one of a handful of categories:</span></p>
                    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p>
                    <p class="c0"><span class="c6">Skimming:</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;Skimming is a tactic best employed against
                            higher-level dungeons by low-level parties. It assumes that in a high-level dungeon, even small incidental
                            treasures will be a big deal for the party. The focus is on exploring as many rooms as possible while
                            avoiding all combat and ignoring anything that might be dangerous. Skimming is also a useful approach for
                            scouting a dungeon before you determine what other strategies you will use.</span></p>
                    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p>
                    <h3>Raiding</h3>
                    <p class="c0">Raiding is probably the default dungeon procedure. Here,
                            the goal is to find the highest-value treasure in the dungeon, strike quickly to either avoid combat
                            entirely or else to defeat any guards before they can organise resistance, and then leave before a
                            counterattack can be mounted. When raiding a dungeon, information gathering is key. </span><span
                            class="c7">Charmed</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;or otherwise coerced captives are probably the best source
                            of information. Beware of blindly blundering around the dungeon.</span></p>
                    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p>
                    <h3>Clearing</h3>
                    <p class="c0">Clearing a dungeon means systematically defeating every
                            threat in every room, and preventing those threats from returning. When clearing a dungeon, information
                            gathering is less important since every threat must be faced eventually. What becomes more important is
                        </span><span class="c7">holding</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;areas of the dungeon. Slow, methodical progress
                            through a dungeon means spending a lot of time and facing a lot of random encounters. Anything that can be
                            done to seal off or capture parts of the dungeon will aid you. Use hirelings to control choke points, spike
                            doors, or even install barriers in the dungeon. Clearing a dungeon in the face of determined intelligent
                            opposition will be next to impossible. Consider a raid to eliminate the centre of resistance before you
                            proceed with clearing.</span></p>
                    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p>
                    <h3>The Yojimbo</h3>
                    <p class="c0">A specialty play best used in Megadungeons
                            or other situations where there are multiple enemy factions. By cleverly allying with various factions you
                            can engineer conflicts which deplete the enemies while minimising your own risk. Preserve your good
                            reputation with as many factions as you can for as long as possible. Never enter a fight unless your allies
                            stand to suffer greater losses than you do. Support the weakest side just long enough for them to gain the
                            upper hand, then switch, inflicting maximum damage with your betrayal.</span></p>
                    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p>
                    <h3>An aside: Dungeon bullshit</h3>
                    <p class="c0">"Dungeon bullshit"     is
                            all that stuff you find in a dungeon that&rsquo;s not treasure, not a trap or a monster, but isn&rsquo;t
                            just decoration either. Magic statues. Fountains with unknown effects. A mysterious roulette wheel. An altar
                            to some forbidden god. Absent some compelling reason, you should leave this stuff alone. While dungeon
                            bullshit is as likely to be harmless or beneficial as it is to be harmful, the risks are rarely worth the
                            rewards. Some minor stat boost or healing or such is unlikely to be worth the risk of death, which is all
                            too common with this kind of encounter. That magic statue is unlikely to be hiding thousands of gold pieces,
                            and that&rsquo;s the only reward that&rsquo;s worth risking your character for.</span></p>
                    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p>
                    <p class="c0"><span>But this cost/benefit analysis isn&rsquo;t the only reason to ignore dungeon bullshit. The real
                            danger of these things is wasted time. Consider: Every moment you spend poking around at that statue,
                            dipping your pinky in that fountain, inhaling the mystic odours of that altar, is time you&rsquo;re
                        </span><span class="c7">not </span><span class="c3">spending looking for more certain rewards in the form of
                            gold and magic items. This is true both in terms of in-game time, where random encounters will sap your
                            strength, and out-of-game time, where you can easily spend an hour of real time bickering about how to
                            safely examine some dungeon bullshit.</span></p>
                    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p>
                    <p class="c0"><span class="c3">Of course, your information gathering might change this calculation. If you learn how
                            to make the dungeon bullshit work for you, or if you&rsquo;ve identified that this particular dungeon
                            bullshit hides a big score, then go ahead and poke and prod at the thing. Likewise, if you&rsquo;re clearing
                            the dungeon it&rsquo;s probably better to at least confirm you&rsquo;re not turning your back on a major
                            source of danger.</span></p>
                    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p>
                    <p class="c0"><span class="c3">If you do decide to interact with dungeon bullshit, it&rsquo;s best approached
                            decisively and systematically. Decide if you intend to trigger it or not trigger it. If you decide to
                            trigger it, it&rsquo;s probably best to do so from as great a distance as possible. In decreasing order of
                            distance, here are the usual ways that dungeon bullshit is triggered:</span></p>
                    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p>
                    <ol class="c5 lst-kix_97zr6bqtctp8-0 start" start="1">
                        <li class="c0 c1 li-bullet-0"><span class="c3">When it sees/hears/otherwise detects you</span></li>
                        <li class="c0 c1 li-bullet-0"><span class="c3">When you enter the room</span></li>
                        <li class="c0 c1 li-bullet-0"><span class="c3">After a certain amount of time (uncommon). This is things like
                                slow poison gas, sleeping things.</span></li>
                        <li class="c0 c1 li-bullet-0"><span class="c3">When you observe it closely (also uncommon). Most often this is
                                things like mirrors, texts, images.</span></li>
                        <li class="c0 c1 li-bullet-0"><span class="c3">When you touch it.</span></li>
                        <li class="c0 c1 li-bullet-0"><span class="c3">When you interact with the thing for its intended function (pull
                                the lever, drink the water, open the box, etc).</span></li>
