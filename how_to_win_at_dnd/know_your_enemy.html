                    <p class="c0"><span class="c3">Different dungeons call for different approaches. Learn to identify the patterns and
                            characteristics of the dungeon you&rsquo;re facing, and use that knowledge to make educated guesses about
                            the kinds of threats you might face. A key question is the &ldquo;level&rdquo; of the dungeon you&rsquo;re
                            facing, and whether that&rsquo;s greater or less than the average level of your party. More difficult
                            dungeons tend to have commensurately greater rewards, but demand more cautious tactics, especially from
                            lower-level parties.</span></p>
                    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p>
                    <p class="c0"><span class="c3">Dungeons can be grouped into five broad classes. Knowing which class a particular
                            dungeon belongs to can help you anticipate likely dangers, though dungeons are highly variable even within a
                            given class.</span></p>
                    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c10 c6"></span></p>
                    <h3 class="c0"><span class="c6 c10">Old-school</span></h3>
                    <p class="c0"><span class="c3">(Keep on the Borderlands, et. al.)</span></p>
                    <p class="c0"><span class="c3">These are the old classics, and the handful of modern dungeons that emulate them.
                            Old-school dungeons assume large parties (up to 10 characters), and expect frequent casualties. That means
                            large numbers of monstrous humanoids, deadly and often arbitrary traps, and little or no internal logic. On
                            the other hand, treasure in these dungeons is often very generous, and magic items are abundant. Old-school
                            dungeons often get more dangerous as you go deeper into the dungeon.</span></p>
                    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c10 c6"></span></p>
                    <h3 class="c0"><span class="c10 c6">New-school</span></h3>
                    <p class="c0"><span class="c3">(Tomb of the Serpent Kings, Hole in the Oak, )</span></p>
                    <p class="c0"><span class="c3">New-school dungeons often have more literary flair than old-school dungeons. They
                            have more distinctive aesthetics, more internal logic, and often more unique encounters. New-school dungeons
                            tend to have smaller encounters, and less arbitrary traps. They can still be very deadly, but they will more
                            often have &ldquo;tells&rdquo; or internal logic which identifies risks early on. Treasure in these dungeons
                            tends to be less generous, but magic items when they are present are often very powerful and unique.</span>
                    </p>
                    <h3 class="c0"><span class="c10 c6">Negadungeon</span></h3>
                    <p class="c0"><span class="c3">(DFD, Xanadu)</span></p>
                    <p class="c0"><span class="c3">The defining feature of a negadungeon is that the only winning move is not to play.
                            They&rsquo;re extremely deadly, often have little or no reward, and can sometimes have campaign-ending
                            consequences. If you&rsquo;ve realised you&rsquo;re in a negadungeon, it&rsquo;s probably already too
                            late.</span></p>
                    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p>
                    <p class="c0"><span class="c3">Another, rarer class of dungeon is the &ldquo;anti-dungeon&rdquo;. This is kind of
                            like a negadungeon-lite. It might not be as deadly or as campaign-threatening, but it&rsquo;s still a waste
                            of time to explore. Best left alone.</span></p>
                    <h3 class="c0"><span class="c10 c6">Puzzle-box</span></h3>
                    <p class="c0"><span class="c3">(Prison of the Hated Pretender)</span></p>
                    <p class="c0"><span class="c3">The puzzle-box dungeon revolves around a single enemy, situation, or magical effect.
                            They present a complex problem which the party must solve, often while also encountering dangerous enemies.
                            The rewards for solving the problem can be great. More than any other kind of dungeon, puzzle-boxes reward
                            careful note-taking. Even quite simple situations can feel very complex when hidden behind the fog of war.
                            This is countered by checking assumptions, reviewing notes, and testing theories.</span></p>
                    <h3 class="c0"><span class="c10 c6">Megadungeon</span></h3>
                    <p class="c0"><span class="c3">Stonehell, Arden Vul, Dwarrowdeep, etc.</span></p>
                    <p class="c0"><span class="c3">Megadungeons are extremely large dungeons, more than a hundred rooms. They can have
                            features of the new-school or old-school dungeon. More than just size, megadungeons are defined by having
                            several &ldquo;zones&rdquo;, each with a different theme and a different set of enemies. A common feature of
                            megadungeons is &ldquo;faction play&rdquo;, multiple groups of enemies with conflicting motives that might
                            be played off against each other. Another common feature of megadungeons is that each level has more
                            difficulty and danger than the one before it.</span></p>
