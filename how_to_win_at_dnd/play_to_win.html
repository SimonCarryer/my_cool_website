                    <p class="c0"><span>The first step to winning at Dungeons and Dragons is to realise that it </span><span
                            class="c7">can</span><span>&nbsp;be won. </span><span class="c3">Your XP total is a score, just like the
                            score in any other game. If you&rsquo;re scoring XP, you&rsquo;re winning the game. If your characters keep
                            dying, you&rsquo;re losing.</span></p>
                    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p>
                    <p class="c0"><span class="c3">In a game as complex and varied as D&amp;D, it&rsquo;s easy to feel like winning and
                            losing is arbitrary, that the points don&rsquo;t matter as long as you&rsquo;re having fun. This is not the
                            case. Smart play, as is described in this document, will eventually, on average, produce results. To play
                            smart requires you to try your best, to pay attention to what works, to feel the bitter sting of defeat when
                            it doesn&rsquo;t, and resolve to do better next time. </span></p>
                    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p>
                    <p class="c0"><span>The axioms presented below are not prescriptions for good D&amp;D, they&rsquo;re </span><span
                            class="c7">descriptions</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;of what has worked in the past. They&rsquo;ve worked
                            reliably in multiple campaigns, across a variety of rules-sets and against a number of different dungeons.
                            They&rsquo;re won through hard experience. But D&amp;D is not a game of rote regurgitation of ancient
                            wisdom. It is a game of discovery. If these axioms don&rsquo;t work in your game, don&rsquo;t wave this
                            document in your DM&rsquo;s face and tell them they&rsquo;re doing it wrong. Clearly, circumstances are
                            different. Each campaign, each DM, each dungeon demands its own calibration. Figure out what works for your
                            game, and then let me know so we can all survive these dungeons a little longer.</span></p>
