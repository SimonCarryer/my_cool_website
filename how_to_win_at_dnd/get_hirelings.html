    <p class="c0"><span class="c3">Especially at low levels, the party is outnumbered by the enemies in the dungeon, and
            those enemies are each at best a roughly equal match to a player character. This equation has an inevitable
            outcome: Combat kills. For dungeon exploration to be anything other than a deadly roulette wheel, the party
            needs to change the equation. Get hirelings. Don&rsquo;t go into the dungeon with four or six swords, go in
            with twenty or more. You want to reliably outnumber all but the largest groups of enemies.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c3">Ten or twenty hirelings represents a massive outlay of costs, and depending on your
            rules, a massive investment in lost XP. It&rsquo;s worth it. XP is rare and hard to come by because dungeons
            are so risky. Reduce the risk, and XP becomes much more of a sure thing.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c3">Once the party has a few levels, these calculations change. Depending on the dungeon,
            you might find the effectiveness of hirelings drops off around 3rd or 4th level.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p>
    <h3>The Spear Block</h3>
    <p class="c0">Hirelings are individually weak. Their
            strength is in numbers. Train and equip them so that they can fight two ranks deep. Holding a corridor
            against charging orcs or goblins means that your party can&rsquo;t be easily surrounded or cut off. In a
            standard 10&rsquo; corridor, it only takes four hirelings to effectively block a corridor fighting in double
            ranks. You can deploy these blocks to seal off areas of the dungeon as you explore.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p>
    <h3>The Crossbow Block</h3>
    <p class="c0">A line of hirelings with crossbows
            is a terrifying thing. Even one volley from eight or ten crossbows is very likely to fell one or two orcs or
            goblins, forcing a morale check and potentially ending the combat before it begins. Train the hirelings to
            form a broad double line in a dungeon room, the front rank kneeling. If the charge is not broken, the
            hirelings can let the party&rsquo;s fighters through to finish the job.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p>
    <h3>Mantlet Doctrine</h3>
    <p class="c0">A dubious practice of some degenerate
            Finns. The hirelings are equipped with large movable wall sections, or mantlets, which they use to block
            corridors and provide an advantageous fighting platform. Combined with crossbows and spears it is an
            effective counter to large groups of unintelligent enemies, such as undead.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p>
    <h3>Hireling management</h3>
    <p class="c0">If your rule system allows it,
            hirelings should be managed by a single player whose character acts as a sergeant for the group. With larger
            number of hirelings you might need multiple sergeants or even NPC sergeants. In any case hireling management
            should be the responsibility of a single player, who tracks their statistics, their hit points, their
            equipment and so on. This play also rolls dice for the hirelings (where possible rolling all dice together
            to save time), and ensures that the hirelings have been paid from the party&rsquo;s funds. Having a single
            manager means that the hirelings can be used to optimal effectiveness, and it makes the record-keeping more
            straightforward and efficient.</span></p>
    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p>
    <h3>Forming a company</h3>
    <p class="c0">The biggest jump in effectiveness for a
            low-level party comes when they make their first big score, and suddenly have the means to hire a decent
            number of hirelings and outfit a respectable dungeon expedition. Once you&rsquo;re sitting on a few hundred
            gold pieces, your options expand dramatically. But this wealth is vulnerable to a sudden defeat. If the
            party is all lost in a dungeon, what happens to their gold? Consider forming a company that holds assets in
            common, in some safe location outside the dungeon. One player should act as quartermaster, keeping track of
            party funds and equipment, purchasing supplies and equipment as required and apportioning shares from
            expeditions according to whatever scheme has been agreed. This is an effective hedge against a party being
            wiped out, as new characters can be drawn from junior members of the company, ensuring they have access to
            the shared funds.</span></p>
