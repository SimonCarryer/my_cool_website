                    <p class="c0"><span class="c3">After your first serious haul in a dungeon, equipment becomes a bit of a non-issue.
                            You can afford just about anything you need, and hirelings can carry whatever you decide to bring. A few
                            simple rubrics cover the issue:</span></p>
                    <ul class="c5 lst-kix_m19vec4ywukr-0 start">
                        <li class="c0 c1 li-bullet-0"><span class="c3">The party should have two or three sources of light. Lanterns are
                                best, but torches have some practical uses, such as for throwing down holes, setting things alight, or
                                leaving in place. Take both.</span></li>
                        <li class="c0 c1 li-bullet-0"><span class="c3">Everyone should have a spare knife or hatchet in addition to
                                their regular weapon.</span></li>
                        <li class="c0 c1 li-bullet-0"><span>At least one character should have a ranged weapon. Depending on the realism
                                level of your game, </span><span class="c7">everyone</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;should have both a
                                ranged and melee weapon. Consider javelins or darts (plumbatae) as a backup ranged weapon -
                                they&rsquo;re more practical than a bow for switching to and from, and the range limitation is hardly an
                                issue in a dungeon.</span></li>
                        <li class="c0 c1 li-bullet-0"><span class="c3">Front-line fighters should have the best armour they can afford,
                                and better armour should be a priority for your first big purchase. The drawbacks of heavy armour
                                (reduced agility, more noise) seldom outweigh the benefits.</span></li>
                        <li class="c0 c1 li-bullet-0"><span class="c3">Spears can act as poles and also as a weapon, so use those
                                instead. A battle-axe can&rsquo;t really do the job of a wood axe, but you might get away with
                                it.</span></li>
                        <li class="c0 c1 li-bullet-0"><span class="c3">Rope is always handy.</span></li>
                        <li class="c0 c1 li-bullet-0"><span class="c3">It&rsquo;s often very useful to have some ability to engineer the
                                dungeon environment, especially opening locked or stuck doors. Consider a selection of crowbars,
                                chisels, pliers, etc. </span></li>
                        <li class="c0 c1 li-bullet-0"><span class="c3">Beyond the above, don&rsquo;t try to anticipate every
                                eventuality. If you end up needing some particular equipment you can always come back with it
                                later.</span></li>
                    </ul>
                    <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p>
                    <p class="c0"><span class="c3">You&rsquo;ve probably seen several lists of &ldquo;dungeon tricks&rdquo; which are
                            purported to be sure-fire clever solutions to dungeon problems. Things like dropping marbles to trip
                            enemies, various uses of flammable oil, caltrops, flour for invisible enemies, etc. In general I&rsquo;m
                            fairly sceptical of these kinds of dungeon tricks. They tend to rely on a kind of looney-tunes logic, and
                            ignore all the impracticalities that would present themselves in real life. I&rsquo;m by no means against
                            lateral thinking or clever play, but these kinds of tricks tend to become kind of stock tropes rather than
                            genuine solutions. </span></p>
